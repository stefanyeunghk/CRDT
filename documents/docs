This project will be focusing on the LWW-Element-Set, and I will implement it based on the structure given in
StructureofstatebasedLWW.png (located inside documents)

Code file: lww.py (located inside crdtcode)
Test file: text_LWW.py (located inside tests)


Requirement given:
implement a state-based LWW-Element-Graph with test cases.
The graph must contain functionalities to add a vertex/edge, remove a vertex/edge, check if a vertex is in the graph,
query for all vertices connected to a vertex, find any path between two vertices, and merge with concurrent changes
from other graph/replica.
